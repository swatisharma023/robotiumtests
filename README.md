Automation tests for Android app

This is a test Android app having 4 activities. First activity is login activity. I have hardcoded username and password as
"admin" and "admin". After login it goes to the second activity. It shows a list of cities to select. On clicking on a city 
it shows a dialog to confirm the selection. Clicking on "Yes" button takes to the third activity. In  third activity there
are a few questions, kind of survey for the selected city. Next activity shows the answers that a user has given.
Whitebox Automation test cases in Robotium to test this app.
